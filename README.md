# CABOOTLE
CABOOTLE has a v2p (Virtual 2 Physical) business platform designed to monetize virtual projects of all kinds in the real world  producing real construction sites, housing construction, electric vehicle designs and more. While the METAVERSE is still in its infancy we want to establish a trusted brand throughout infinity and space. Understanding the universal collaboration being deployed with blockchain technology, digital currency, physical hands-on technology such as drones and automated vehicles (trucking delivery and civilian). As this technology matures and our lives become more intertwined it enables us to deal with each other intimately like no other time in humanity while excising a safe social distance during these turbulent times of change. We are witnessing the largest shift in wealth and power ever known to man in which age, race, sex, or geographic locations will matter. INTIGRITY and transparency will be available to those who we let into our worlds both physically and virtually. Our base will start with a virtual affordable housing and development program designed to locate real properties that qualify for multi-family housing and small business development in both rural and urban areas. We understand that there is a learning curve with this new technology and we want to support it in everyway. For our members you earn while you learn and get paid to play. We want our virtual resources to provide the whole CABOOTLE
